# ETLtools
Tools to facilitate ETLing in R


## Enumerate-like functionality

When using loop-like constructs, either via a regular for loop, or with lapply, you normally have to choose between iterating over the object itself or over its index. Enumerate give you both at once.

To see how, read the vignette: `vignette("enumerate", package = "ETLtools")` or from github: [link](http://example.com).
